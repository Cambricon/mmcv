Cambricon MMCV extends its functionality through incremental releases, building upon the foundations set by MMLab MMCV's previously published version.

We currently extend support to the MMCV versions 2.1.0 and 1.7.1. For enhancements and updates specific to MMCV version 2.1.0, our development is channeled through the 'dev-2.1' branch. Similarly, updates for MMCV version 1.7.1 are managed via the 'dev-1.7' branch.
